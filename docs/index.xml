      <title>Merge Queues with Bors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many engineering teams and open source projects are introducing merge queues as
part of their workflows. This post explores several reasons for using a merge
queue and describes how to set up Bors, the merge queue implementation used by
the Rust language project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Speed up Rust Builds with Cachepot</title>
      <link>https://kflansburg.com/posts/rust-cachepot/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways for speeding up Rust builds is to cache the
compiled artifacts of crate dependencies. Cargo does this automatically for
local builds, but this quickly breaks down for distributed scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will share my experiences with configuring and using Cachepot,
a tool which wraps the Rust compiler and automatically caches build artifacts
using a variety of cloud storage options. This creates a cache which can be
shared amongst teams, used in ephemeral CI/CD environments, and even used for
distributed builds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Failure Modes</title>
      <link>https://kflansburg.com/posts/ordered-stateful-streaming/failure-modes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the fourth post of this series I will outline several sources of failure in
streaming applications. In each case I discuss the potential for data loss and
possible mitigations. This analysis can drive decisions on the tradeoff between
infrastructure costs and the upper bound on data loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the third post of this series I will share operational and practical issues
that I have encountered when developing and hosting long-running Spark
streaming applications. This includes tips that will be useful to those who are
first starting out with Scala and Spark, as well as insights on performance and
reliability that will be useful to those who are more experienced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Krator: My God, it&#39;s Full of States!</title>
      <link>https://kflansburg.com/posts/introducing-krator/</link>

      <description>At the beginning of February, I published my second guest post on Deis Labs&#39; blog, which introduced Krator. Pronounced &amp;ldquo;crater&amp;rdquo;, this crate allows you to build Kubernetes Operators in Rust, using the state machine API that we designed for Krustlet last year. Check out the post for an example of writing an Operator with this crate!</description>

      <title>Selecting a Framework</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the second post of this series I explore the strengths and weaknesses of
several popular streaming frameworks. This analysis was performed a couple of
years ago with a particular application in mind. These frameworks have since
improved, but this post should provide some insight into the tradeoffs and
decisions involved when designing streaming applications, and lessons can be
learned from choices that did and did not pay off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently spent two weeks tracking down a subtle bug in a Spark Structured
Streaming application which I have been maintaining for several years. Having
dealt with many such time-consuming bugs over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to
compile my experiences working with ordered, stateful streaming applications
into a series of posts. This series will serve as an introductory guide to the
design and operation of stateful streaming pipelines, and hopefully spur some
further development to simplify this process in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rust Continuous Delivery</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years I have iterated several times on continuous delivery
pipelines for Rust applications. Designing these pipelines involves balancing
a number of factors including cost, complexity, ergonomics, and rigor. In this
post I will describe several of these iterations, lessons learned, and share my
most recent solution in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>My recent guest post on Deis Labs&#39; blog offers a deep dive into my work on Krustlet, including the design and implementation of a flexible state machine API for specifying custom Kubelet behavior in a type-safe framework.</description>
