                <p>Many engineering teams and open source projects are introducing merge queues as
part of their workflows. This post explores several reasons for using a merge
queue and describes how to set up Bors, the merge queue implementation used by
the Rust language project.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-merge-queue">What is a Merge Queue?</h2>
<p>A merge queue is an application that integrates with your version control system
(this post will focus on <code>git</code> and GitHub) to require that code changes are
merged <em>atomically</em>, which ensures that the main branch always contains a
version of the code that has been fully tested.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>
<p>Atomic merges are achieved by requiring that all pull requests (PRs) go through
a <em>queue</em> in order to be merged to the main branch. This ensures that all
branches are merged using a specific process. That process is:</p>
<p><a href="/merge-queues/overview.svg">
<figure>
  <img src="/merge-queues/overview.svg" alt="Architecture Overview" />
</figure>


</a></p>
<ol>
<li>A PR is approved by humans, and the branch is added to the queue.</li>
<li>Later, the branch is taken off the queue when it reaches the top. A canary
branch is created by merging this branch with the main branch.</li>
<li>The canary branch is run through the full test suite, ensuring that this
exact version of the code passes.</li>
<li>IFF the tests pass, the main branch is updated to point to the canary branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process ensures that the main branch only ever points to versions of the
code which have been fully tested. It may seem counterintuitive that this is not
already ensured by a typical workflow, so let&rsquo;s look at a concrete example of
how this assumption can be broken.</p>
<p>GitHub supports several <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/about-merge-methods-on-github">merge strategies</a>
when merging a pull request. In each case, when the PR is merged, changes are
combined with the latest version of the main branch <em>at the time of merge</em>,
which creates an <em>entirely new commit</em>. There are a number of ways in which this
can result in untested combinations of code on the main branch.</p>
<p>The canonical example, paraphrased from <a href="https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng#but-dont-githubs-protected-branches-already-do-this">Bors' documentation</a>, is that
two pull requests are open at the same time (a common occurrence in popular
projects):</p>
<ol>
<li>Invokes a method <code>foo()</code> in a new location.</li>
<li><em>Renames</em> <code>foo()</code> to <code>bar()</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/merge-queues/multiple.svg">
<figure>
  <img src="/merge-queues/multiple.svg" alt="Multiple PR Example" />
</figure>


</a></p>
<p>Both pull requests are branched from the same version of <code>main</code>, meaning that
the second pull request is not aware of the new call sight for the function, and
does not rename it. The test suite for both pull requests will pass, and GitHub
will happily merge the two requests. The result is that <code>main</code> contains a broken
version of the code which invokes the nonexistent function <code>foo()</code> somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-branch-protection">What about Branch Protection?</h3>
<p><a href="/merge-queues/rebase.svg">
<figure>
  <img src="/merge-queues/rebase.svg" alt="Rebase Example" />
</figure>


</a></p>
<p>GitHub allows you to set a number of rules related to when and how PRs can be
merged. One solution to the above problem would be to &ldquo;Require branches to be up
to date&rdquo;. In the above example, the first PR would merge successfully, but then
the author of the second PR would need to rebase their branch on <code>main</code> (so
that it is up-to-date), and then would discover the problem when tests failed.</p>
<p><a href="/merge-queues/multiple-rebase.svg">
<figure>
  <img src="/merge-queues/multiple-rebase.svg" alt="Multiple Rebase Example" />
</figure>


</a></p>
<p>This approach works, but can become extremely tiresome for projects with many
contributors and a long build process. Imagine now that there were three
original PRs. After the first merges, the two other authors rebase and begin
waiting for tests to complete. The first one to complete tests and merge wins
the race, the other now has to rebase and test again. This results in multi-hour
babysitting exercise to just land your one PR.</p>
<h2 id="production-artifact-builds">Production Artifact Builds</h2>
<p>Many projects build a production artifact, such as container image with
<a href="https://drydock.app?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=merge-queues&amp;utm_content=production-artifacts">DryDock</a>
or a release binary, for each unique commit to certain branches. This
artifact eventually makes it to production via continuous delivery, and can
always be traced back to a specific revision of the main branch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as mentioned above, GitHub <em>always</em> creates a new commit when
merging. This means that there is always some period of time
where you have merged a change but the production artifact is still being built.
It also results in a relatively unnecessary second build, since this version of
the code should have been tested and built <em>before</em> merging. Lastly, there is
a possibility that the final build could fail (even for spurious reasons),
leaving you in a bad spot.</p>
<p><a href="/merge-queues/artifacts.svg">
<figure>
  <img src="/merge-queues/artifacts.svg" alt="Multiple Builds Example" />
</figure>


</a></p>
<p>An astute reader would be familiar with <code>git</code>&rsquo;s capability for <em>fast-forward</em>
merges, where a branch which is up-to-date with the main branch is merged by
simply updating the branch pointer for <code>main</code> to include the new commits. GitHub
<em>sort-of</em> supports this with their &ldquo;Rebase Merge&rdquo; option, but this still
<em>creates a new commit</em> (I think to add additional metadata), resulting in an
unnecessary build.</p>
<p>It is possible to manually conduct this merge on your local machine and then
push to <code>main</code>, but this is clearly not a scalable solution. Merge queues can
solve this problem because many of them support doing a true fast-forward merge
after the build on the canary branch has completed.</p>
<h2 id="too-many-prs">Too Many PRs</h2>
<p>Even with the above process (rebase, test, merge) automated, there is one more
problem. Say your test suite takes 30 minutes to complete, but your project
averages 50 PRs a day. You will forever fall behind because you can only merge
~48 PRs a day when done one at a time! Many merge queues offer advanced
functionality to support batching. This involves combining the changes from PRs
that are approved at roughly the same time, testing them together, and then
merging them in a group.</p>
<p><a href="/merge-queues/batching.svg">
<figure>
  <img src="/merge-queues/batching.svg" alt="Batching Example" />
</figure>


</a></p>
<p>This can introduce some complexities: how to handle a failed group test (i.e.
identify which PR introduced the failure), and how to prioritize or test
specific PRs in isolation. Many merge queue implementations have functionality
to handle these scenarios, but that is out of scope for this post.</p>
<h2 id="using-bors">Using Bors</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen <em>why</em> you might want to use a merge queue, lets see how
set your project up to use one. In this post we will look at
<a href="https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng">Bors</a>, which is the merge queue that you
will see used on the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">Rust Language project repository</a>.</p>
<p>Bors is a GitHub application, which makes it very easy to integrate with a
GitHub project. There is a <a href="https://bors.tech/">free hosted solution</a>, but it
only supports public repositories. If you want to use Bors with a private
repository, you will need to host your own.</p>
<h4 id="hosted-solution">Hosted Solution</h4>
<p>To use the hosted solution, simply
<a href="https://github.com/apps/bors/installations/new">install the GitHub App</a>, making
sure to share the repository you want to use.</p>
<h4 id="self-hosted">Self-Hosted</h4>
<p>The self-hosted option is relatively easy to set up and maintain as well. The
Bors repository provides
<a href="https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng#how-to-set-up-your-own-real-instance">documentation</a>
for how to deploy Bors on Heroku which, at a high level involves:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/settings/apps">Create a GitHub App</a> for the deployment to
use. The documentation includes detailed instructions for the permissions and
events you should configure for your app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click below to create a deployment of Bors on Heroku. Fill out the
application form with details from your GitHub App and click Deploy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng">
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy" />
</figure>


</a></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Install the GitHub App you created in your account or organization and grant
it access to your repository.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>Once you have Bors connected to your repository, you will need to make a few
final changes.</p>
<h4 id="test-triggers">Test Triggers</h4>
<p>Your continuous integration tool should be reconfigured to trigger tests for the
<code>staging</code> and <code>trying</code> branch, which are the branches Bors will use for testing
changes before merging.</p>
<p>I typically split up my tests into two sets based on how long they take to run.
Fast tests like linting can be run for all branches, so that you can see their
results prior to submitting to the merge queue. Slower tests are moved to only
run on <code>staging</code> and <code>trying</code> so that they are not run redundantly.</p>
<p>Bors provides some
<a href="https://bors.tech/documentation/getting-started/">documentation</a> for how to
reconfigure a number of different CI tools.</p>
<h4 id="bors-configuration">Bors Configuration</h4>
<p>The last step is to configure Bors' behavior for your repository. This is done
by creating a <code>bors.toml</code> file in the repository root.</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt" id="0"><a style="outline: none; text-decoration:none; color:inherit" href="#0">0</a>
</span><span class="lnt" id="1"><a style="outline: none; text-decoration:none; color:inherit" href="#1">1</a>
</span><span class="lnt" id="2"><a style="outline: none; text-decoration:none; color:inherit" href="#2">2</a>
</span><span class="lnt" id="3"><a style="outline: none; text-decoration:none; color:inherit" href="#3">3</a>
</span><span class="lnt" id="4"><a style="outline: none; text-decoration:none; color:inherit" href="#4">4</a>
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span class="c"># Test name(s) which must complete before PR is added to merge queue.</span>
<span class="nx">pr_status</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&#34;lint&#34;</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="c"># Test name(s) which must complete on canary branch.</span>
<span class="nx">status</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&#34;test&#34;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>At a minimum, this file should specify the tests that need to pass on the canary
branch before it can be merged. You can also specify the tests which must pass
on PR branches before they are accepted into the queue. The literal name of the
tests can be a little tricky to determine depending on which CI tool you use.
Check out the documentation link above for some examples.</p>
<h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>
<p>To verify that Bors is working, you can comment <code>bors ping</code> in a pull request,
and Bors should comment with a reply.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="/merge-queues/ping.png" alt="Ping Example" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>When you wish to merge a PR, instead of pressing the big green merge button,
comment <code>bors r+</code>. Bors will comment in acknowledgement. If you configured Bors
to require some tests to pass before adding a PR to the queue, and those tests
are still running, then Bors will comment to let you know that it is waiting for
these to complete.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="/merge-queues/pr-status.png" alt="PR Status Example" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Once the canary tests are running for the PR, you should see
a new GitHub status from Bors on the pull request. This status will show a green
check once the tests succeed.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="/merge-queues/status.png" alt="Status Example" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>When the tests pass, Bors will automatically merge the changes, and comment a
summary of the tests run on the canary branch.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="/merge-queues/complete.png" alt="Complete Example" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>The merge commit will include a summary of the PRs included in the merge (if
using batching), and indicate all PR authors as co-authors of the commit.</p>
<p>To learn about all of the possible commands for Bors, check out this
<a href="https://bors.tech/documentation/">documentation</a>.</p>
<h4 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>If you are using the hosted offering, be sure that the repository is not
private. This is unsupported.</p>
<p>For the self-hosted offering, if Bors does not seem to be responding to comments
or successful tests, double check the <em>events</em> that the GitHub App is subscribed
to. The necessary events are indicated in the
<a href="https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng#required-github-app-permissions">list of permissions</a>
in Bors' documentation. You may also wish to double check the names of the tests
you specified in <code>bors.toml</code>. You can view the log output from Bors on Heroku,
as well as the GitHub webhook payloads (in the App configuration, under the
Advanced tab) to cross reference the names of the tests being reported.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Merge queues are a powerful tool for automating your code contribution process.
They can be especially impactful for projects that have long-running test suites
and many active contributors. Bors is one implementation of a merge queue which
can be set up very easily for public projects. Private projects can set up a
self-hosted deployment of Bors quickly using Heroku as well. Thanks for reading!</p>
