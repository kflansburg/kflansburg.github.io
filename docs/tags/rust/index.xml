      <title>Speed up Rust Builds with Cachepot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways for speeding up Rust builds is to cache the
compiled artifacts of crate dependencies. Cargo does this automatically for
local builds, but this quickly breaks down for distributed scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will share my experiences with configuring and using Cachepot,
a tool which wraps the Rust compiler and automatically caches build artifacts
using a variety of cloud storage options. This creates a cache which can be
shared amongst teams, used in ephemeral CI/CD environments, and even used for
distributed builds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Krator: My God, it&#39;s Full of States!</title>

      <description>At the beginning of February, I published my second guest post on Deis Labs&#39; blog, which introduced Krator. Pronounced &amp;ldquo;crater&amp;rdquo;, this crate allows you to build Kubernetes Operators in Rust, using the state machine API that we designed for Krustlet last year. Check out the post for an example of writing an Operator with this crate!</description>

      <title>Rust Continuous Delivery</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years I have iterated several times on continuous delivery
pipelines for Rust applications. Designing these pipelines involves balancing
a number of factors including cost, complexity, ergonomics, and rigor. In this
post I will describe several of these iterations, lessons learned, and share my
most recent solution in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>My recent guest post on Deis Labs&#39; blog offers a deep dive into my work on Krustlet, including the design and implementation of a flexible state machine API for specifying custom Kubelet behavior in a type-safe framework.</description>
