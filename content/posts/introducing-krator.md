At the beginning of February, I published my second
[guest post on Deis Labs' blog](https://deislabs.io/posts/introducing-krator/),
which introduced Krator. Pronounced "crater", this crate allows you to build
Kubernetes Operators in Rust, using the state machine API that we designed for
Krustlet last year. Check out the post for an example of writing an Operator
with this crate!
